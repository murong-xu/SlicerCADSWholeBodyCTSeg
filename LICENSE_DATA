CADS-dataset License

The CADS-dataset provides curated anatomical segmentation masks and other derived data for CT images collected from multiple public sources.
While the original CT scans remain the property of their respective dataset owners (see dataset documentation: https://huggingface.co/datasets/mrmrx/CADS-dataset),
all derivatives were created by the CADS team.
